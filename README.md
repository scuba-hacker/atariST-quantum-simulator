Quantum Simulator - description to follow!

The A-Level Chemistry syllabus from 1994 included theory on how the entropy/enthalpy of gases changes over time. The quanta energy model is used to implement a demo of this theory in action.

Requires:

* Atari STFM or Atari STe emulator or physical hardware
* Mono High Resolution monitor at 640 x 400 resolution, emulated or physical hardware
* To run from code use GFA Basic v3 or v3.5 and load src/total1.lst
* To run the binary directly run bin/quantum.tos
